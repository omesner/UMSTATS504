## Consulting Skills Focus

- In real life consulting, the client will frequently understand the data and surrounding research better than the data scientist/statistician.


- Analysis should center around a well-defined research question that drive the analysis and the data should be able to provide insight on the question of interest.
- Human bias and data analysis: We all have bias.  This can influence data analysis.  A data analyst, we should do our best to objectively present the data.  When necessary to make assumptions, state them explicitly.  
- Publication Bias example: Researchers frequently want "positive results."  Usually this means significant p-values.  Variable selection is a simple way to change p-values, p-hacking.  It's common to need to change variables in a model be it should be done a principled way.
- Question: Have you heard of field of [algorithmic fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning))?
  - a) yes
  - b) no

## Case Study Background

- US has more inmates, proportional to population size, than any other country.   While Black Americans make up 13% of the total US population, they account for 40% of incarcerated population in the US.

- In the US justice system, machine learning algorithms are sometimes used to assess a criminal defendant's risk of recidivism (arrest due to committing a future crime) are being used.


- Correctional Offenders Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) is the most widespread of these algorithms.
- Its goal according to COMPAS creators: assess "not just risk but also nearly two dozen so-called “criminogenic needs” that relate to the major theories of criminality, including “criminal personality,” “social isolation,” “substance abuse” and “residence/stability.” Defendants are ranked low, medium or high risk in each category."
- In 2014, then U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder warned that the risk scores might be injecting bias into the courts. He called for the U.S. Sentencing Commission to study their use. “Although these measures were crafted with the best of intentions, I am concerned that they inadvertently undermine our efforts to ensure individualized and equal justice,” he said, adding, “they may exacerbate unwarranted and unjust disparities that are already far too common in our criminal justice system and in our society.”
- The [questionnaire](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2702103-Sample-Risk-Assessment-COMPAS-CORE.html) for determining COMPAS does not directly ask for race, but some people question inherent racial bias in the algorithm.
- The COMPAS algorithm is proprietary and not available.
- More information in a [2016 ProPublica article](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing).


## Data

- ProPublica requested two years of COMPAS scores from Broward County Sheriff's Office in Florida


- Discarded all but pre-trial COMPAS score assessments
- ProPublica matched COMPAS scores with criminal records from Broward County Clerk's Office website
- COMPAS score screening date and (original) arrest date frequently differed.  If they are too far apart, that may indicate an error.  The `days_b_screening_arrest` variable gives this difference in days.
- `is_recid` is rearrest at any time.  `two_year_recid` is rearrest within two years.  Here, `-1` indicates a COMPAS record could not be found and should probably be discarded
- COMPAS generates a general score, `decile_score`, (1, 2,...,10) where 1 indicates a low risk and 10 indicates a high risk of recidivism.  There is also a violence score as well, `v_decile_score`.

```{r}
dat<-read.csv("./compas-scores.csv")
dim(dat)
names(dat)
head(dat[,1:12])
summary(dat)
```

Are there multiple rows per person?

```{r}
length(unique(dat$id))
length(dat$id)
length(unique(dat$name))
sort(table(dat$name), decreasing=TRUE)[1:8]

```

- To me, these seem like common names, so it could be a coincidence, but I would check with the client as due diligence

- What else could we do to check?

What about other demographics?

```{r sex}
table(dat$sex)
table(dat$sex)/sum(!is.na(dat$sex))*100
```


```{r age}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(dat, aes(x=age, color=sex, fill=sex)) +
  geom_histogram(position="dodge")
```

```{r race}
ggplot(dat, aes(race)) +
  geom_bar(fill='blue')
ggplot(dat, aes(x=race, fill=sex)) +
  geom_bar(position='dodge')
```

```{r compas}
ggplot(dat, aes(decile_score)) +
  geom_histogram()
table(!is.na(dat$decile_score))
```

General recommendations:

- Look at the raw data and different plots of the data before doing any modeling.


- Look for missing data and for values that might not make sense.
- Make sure you understand what observations (rows) are included in the data and which of those observations serve your data analysis goals
- Try to understand what the variables (columns) represent and which ones will serve your data analysis goals

## Quantifying racial bias

- Before doing any analysis, let's look at recidivism, COMPAS, and race

```{r Race and Recidivism}
df <- dat[dat$is_recid != -1,]
sum(is.na(df$race))
sum(is.na(df$is_recid))
table(df$race, df$is_recid)[,2]/t(table(df$race))*100
```
Above is the recidivism rate by race

- COMPAS also gave Black Americans greater scores on average:
```{r}
tapply(df$decile_score, df$race, mean)
```
Is this the best way to present this information?

## How to model algorithmic bias?
- What does bias mean here?


- Would COMPAS give someone a greater score solely due to being Black or some other demographic, without changing anything else?


- Stated differently, if two people have the same risk of recidivism, with race being their only difference, will the algorithm score them differently


- Remember COMPAS doesn't ask for race directly


- Question: how could this happen theoretically?


- How could we quantify bias in this case?  Are race and COMPAS still associated after taking recidivism into account?


- It is tempting to use `decile_score ~ is_recid + race` to quantify the association between COMPAS and race while controlling for recidivism.

## Causation and Collider Bias

![XKCD causal comic](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/correlation.png)

### Bayesian Network 1:

```{r chain, echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', out.height= '40%'}
library(DiagrammeR)
grViz("digraph flowchart {A -> B -> C [constraint=false]}")
```

Mental Model: Think of a dataset where $A,B,C$ are collected

- $A$ = Alcohol
- $B$ = Hangover
- $C$ = Miss Class

Question: What would a regression model of `C ~ A + B` yield?

- a) Both $A$ and $B$ should be statistically significant
- b) Only $A$ should be statistically significant
- c) Only $B$ should be statistically significant
- d) Neither $A$ nor $B$ should be statistically significant

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
size <- 1000
A <- 6*rnorm(size)+50
B <- -2*A - 25 + rnorm(size)
C <- 5*B + 3 +rnorm(size)
summary(lm(C~A+B))
```

Question: What about this regression model: `C ~ A`?

- a) $A$ should be statistically significant
- b) $A$ should not be statistically significant

```{r}
summary(lm(C~A))
```

- Coefficient estimates:
$$\begin{align}
C &= 5B + 3 + \epsilon_B \\
&= 5(-2A - 25 + \epsilon_A) \\
&= -10A - 122 + 5\epsilon_A + \epsilon_B
\end{align}$$

Question: Does this coefficient and intercept estimate make sense?

- a) yes
- b) nope

### Bayesian Network 2:
```{r fork, echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', out.height='40%'}
grViz("digraph flowchart {A -> B; A -> C;}")
```

Mental Model:

- $A$ = Smoker
- $B$ = Yellow Teeth
- $C$ = Cancer

Question: What would a regression model of `C ~ A + B` yield?

- a) Both $A$ and $B$ should be statistically significant
- b) Only $A$ should be statistically significant
- c) Only $B$ should be statistically significant
- d) Neither $A$ nor $B$ should be statistically significant

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
size <- 1000
A <- 6*rnorm(size)+50
B <- -2*A - 25 + rnorm(size)
C <- 2*A +5 +rnorm(size)
summary(lm(C~A+B))
```

Question: What about this regression model: `C ~ A`?

- a) $A$ should be statistically significant
- b) $A$ should not be statistically significant

### Bayesian Network 3:
```{r collider, echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', out.height='40%'}
grViz("digraph flowchart {A -> C; B -> C;}")
```

Mental Model:

- $A$ = Allergies
- $B$ = Flu
- $C$ = Sinus

Question: What would a regression model of `C ~ A + B` yield?

- a) Both $A$ and $B$ should be statistically significant
- b) Only $A$ should be statistically significant
- c) Only $B$ should be statistically significant
- d) Neither $A$ nor $B$ should be statistically significant

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
size <- 1000
A <- 6*rnorm(size)+50
B <- -2*rnorm(size) - 25 + rnorm(size)
C <- -4*A + 5*B + 3 +rnorm(size)
summary(lm(C~A+B))
```

### Bayesian Network 3 (again) with `A` as the outcome:

```{r collider2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', out.height='40%'}
grViz("digraph flowchart {A -> C; B -> C;}")
```

Question: What would a regression model of `A ~ B + C` yield?

- a) Both $B$ and $C$ should be statistically significant
- b) Only $B$ should be statistically significant
- c) Only $C$ should be statistically significant
- d) Neither $B$ nor $C$ should be statistically significant

```{r}
summary(lm(A~B+C))
```

Question: What would a regression model of `A ~ B` yield?

- a) $B$ should be statistically significant
- b) $B$ should not be statistically significant

```{r}
summary(lm(A~B))
```

- Even though `A` and `B` are independent, they are *conditionally dependent* if controlling for `C`.
- Why did this happen?  Does it make sense?
- Consider $A\sim \text{Bernoulli}(0.5), B\sim \text{Bernoulli}(0.5)$ (independent coin flips), and $C = A\cdot B$.  
- $A$ and $B$ are independent; that is, knowledge of $B$ give no information on the value of $A$. But, additional knowledge of $C$ does give information about the value of $A$.

**Bayesian Network 4**
```{r shielded collider, echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%'}
grViz("digraph flowchart {A -> C; B -> C; A -> B}")
```

Mental Model:

- $A$ = Study into the night
- $B$ = Go to bed late
- $C$ = Fail Test

Question: What would a regression model of `C ~ A + B` yield?

- a) Both $A$ and $B$ should be statistically significant
- b) Only $A$ should be statistically significant
- c) Only $B$ should be statistically significant
- d) Neither $A$ nor $B$ should be statistically significant

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
size <- 1000
A <- 6*rnorm(size)+50
B <- A - 2*rnorm(size) - 25 + rnorm(size)
C <- -4*A + 5*B + 3 +rnorm(size)
summary(lm(C~A+B))
```

Question: What about this regression model: `C ~ A`?

- a) $A$ should be statistically significant
- b) $A$ should not be statistically significant

```{r}
summary(lm(C~A))
```

Question: What about this regression model: `B ~ A + C`?

- a) Both $A$ and $C$ should be statistically significant
- b) Only $A$ should be statistically significant
- c) Only $C$ should be statistically significant
- d) Neither $A$ nor $C$ should be statistically significant

```{r}
summary(lm(B~A+C))
```

## COMPAS and possible collider bias

- COMPAS uses [questionnaire](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2702103-Sample-Risk-Assessment-COMPAS-CORE.html) responses to predict recidivism.  

- Because COMPAS is used in sentencing, it may actually impact recidivism as well.

- One way to quantify racial bias in COMPAS would be to isolate the link between race and COMPAS that is not associated with recidivism.  But, it is not clear how to untangle this from potential collider bias.

```{dot, out.width = '40%'}
digraph {
  Race -> COMPAS [ label = "?"];
  COMPAS -> Recidivism [ label = "?"]; 
  Race -> Recidivism [ label = "?"]
  }
```

- If we used `decile_score ~ is_recid + race` as a model to quantify bias, it seems very likely that there will be collider bias

- IMPORTANT: The model below is NOT informative because of the possible causal structure of the data
  - Included for teaching purposes only

```{r compasColliderBias}
summary(lm(decile_score ~ is_recid + race, data=df))
```

In the regression above, several race indicator variables are significant.  But, because collider bias is possible here, we *cannot* conclude that COMPAS is racially biased.

## Survival Analysis

- Survival analysis is a set of statistical methods for modeling the time until an event occurs, especially when follow up is not complete for each observation.

- Example: Testing a new terminal cancer treatment, participants are either given the standard or test treatment.  The goal is to prolong the patient's life.  Each patient is followed until death from cancer.  During follow up some participants die from cancer but some drop out while others might die from something else.  Survival analysis allows us to use this data even though we do not have events for each participant.

**Set up**

- Assume that $T$ is the time until an event randomly occurs.

- For example, $T$ might be the duration from cancer treatment until remission or death.
- $T\sim f$: $f(t)$ is the probability density function (pdf) of $T$ where $t$ is time
- $F(t)=P(T<t)=\int_0^tf(x)dx$ is cumulative distribution function (cdf) of $T$
- Survival function:
$$S(t)=P(T>t)=1-F(t)$$
- The survival function gives the probability of not having an event before time $t$ (survive until $t$)

- Hazard function:
\[
\lambda(t)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{P(t<T\leq t+h)}{P(T>t)}= \frac{f(t)}{S(t)} = -\frac{d\log S(t)}{dt}.
\]
- Hazard give the instantaneous probability of an event at time $t$ given survival until time $t$
- Notice that $f(t)=\lambda(t)S(t)$
- Cumulative hazard function:
\[
\Lambda(t)= \int_0^t\lambda(x)dx=-\int_0^td\log S(x)=-\log S(t).
\]
- How to get the survival function from the hazard function:
\[
S(t)=\exp[-\Lambda(t)].
\]
- Side note: If $\lambda(t)=\lambda$ (constant function), then $f$ is the exponential distribution:
$$
\begin{align*}
  \lambda(t)=\lambda 
  &\Leftrightarrow \Lambda(t)=\lambda t \\
  &\Leftrightarrow S(t)=\exp(-\lambda t) \\
  &\Leftrightarrow f(t)= \lambda(t) S(t) = \lambda\exp(-\lambda t)
\end{align*}
$$

**Censoring at Random**

- Not always possible to wait for an event to occur for each participant before doing the analysis

- Cancer study example: participants may drop out of the study before an event is observed or the study may close before each participant experiences an event
- This is call right censored data: have start time but end times can either be at event or drop out time
- Question: For censored observations, how to make use of time duration without event?

![right censoring image from [here](http://reliawiki.org/index.php/Life_Data_Classification)](./Right_censoring.png)

- Model: $f(t|x; \theta)$ with corresponding hazard, $\lambda(t|x;\theta)$, and survival, $S(t|x;\theta)$

- Want $\theta$ to quantify difference in risk (until event) among observations
  - Note: $\theta$ quantifies how fast an event will likely occur for an observation but communicated in terms of risk of event
- Assumption: censoring occurs at random (in independently from $f$)
- Censoring cumulative probability distribution model:
$$G(t;\phi)$$
- Corresponding censoring pdf model:
$$g(t;\phi)$$
- Data:
$$(t_1, \delta_1),\dots, (t_n,\delta_n)$$
- $t_i$ for $i=1,\dots,n$ is duration of follow-up until either event or censor time
- $\delta_i$ is event indicator:
  - $\delta_i=1$ means that observation $i$ had an event and $t_i \sim f(t;\theta)$
  - $\delta_i=0$ means that observation $i$ was censored and $t_i \sim g(t;\phi)$
- Because $f$ and $g$ are independent (and because observations are independent), the likelihood is 
\[
\begin{align}
L(\theta,\phi) &= \prod_{i=1}^n [f(t_i;\theta)[1-G(t_i;\phi)]]^{\delta_i} [g(t_i;\phi)S(t_i;\theta)]^{1-\delta_i}\\
&=  \prod_{i=1}^n [f(t_i;\theta)]^{\delta_i}[S(t_i;\theta)]^{1-\delta_i} \prod_{i=1}^n [g(t_i;\phi)]^{1-\delta_1}[1-G(t_i;\phi)]^{\delta_i}\\
&= L(\theta) L(\phi) \propto L(\theta).
\end{align}
\]

- Oobserve an event for $i$ ($\delta_i=1$), then $t_i\sim f$ and censoring did not occur prior $[f(t_i;\theta)[1-G(t_i;\phi)]]^{\delta_i}$

- Observe censoring for $i$ ($\delta_i=1$), then $t_i\sim g$ and an event did not occur prior $[g(t_i;\phi)S(t_i;\theta)]^{1-\delta_i}$
- But, we do not care about the censoring distribution, only the time to event distribution.
- Partial likelihood 
$$L(\theta)=\prod_{i=1}^n [f(t_i;\theta)]^{\delta_i}[S(t_i;\theta)]^{1-\delta_i}= \prod_{i=1}^n \lambda(t_i)^{\delta_i} S(t_i)$$ 

## Kaplan-Meier Estimator

- Consider estimating survival: $S(t) = P(T>t)$ from sample $(t_1, \delta_1),\dots, (t_n,\delta_n)$

- Approximate $S(t)$ as a non-parametric decreasing step function
  - $S(t)$ is proportion of sample that has not experienced an event at time $t$
  - Problem: If $i$ censored prior to $t$, we cannot know if their event occurred before or after $t$
- Order sample by event times $t_i$ where $\delta_i=1$: 
$$t_{(1)}, t_{(2)}, \dots, t_{(J)}$$
- There are only $J$ sample points in time where events occur
- Recall conditional probability rule $P(A|B)=\frac{P(A,B)}{P(B)}$
- Because $t_{(j)} > t_{(j-1)}$,
$$S(t_{(j)}) = P(T > t_{(j)}) = P(T > t_{(j)}, T > t_{(j-1)}) = P(T > t_{(j)} | T > t_{(j-1)}) P(T > t_{(j-1)})$$
- Repeating
$$S(t_{(j)}) = P(T > t_{(j)} | T > t_{(j-1)}) P(T > t_{(j-1)} | T > t_{(j-2)}) P(T > t_{(j-2)})$$
- For $j = 1,\dots, J$, the "instantaneous" probability of an event occurring at time $t_j$:
$$\pi_j = 1-P\left(T > t_{(j)} | T > t_{(j-1)}\right)$$
- Then 
\[
S(t_{(j)}) = (1-\pi_j)(1-\pi_{j-1}) \dots (1-\pi_2)(1-\pi_1).
\]
- Calculate $\pi_j$:
  - Let $n_j = \#\{t_i \geq t_{(j)}\}$ be the number of participants who are still at risk (who haven't had an event or been censored) at time $t_{(j)}$
  
  - Note: that $n_j$ decreases as events occur or as they are censored.
  - Let $d_j = \#\{t_i=t_{(j)}, \delta_i=1\}$ be the number of events that occur at time $t_{(j)}$.
  - Maximizes the non-parametric likelihood
  $$\pi_j = \frac{d_j}{n_j}$$
- So, we can approximate the survival function as
\[
\hat S(t) = \prod_{j=1}^J \left( 1-\frac{d_j}{n_j}\right)^{I(t_{(j)}\leq t)}.
\]
- Using the delta-method, we can approxmiate the variance of the estimated survival function as 
\[
\hat V[\hat S(t)] = \hat S(t)^2 \sum_{j: t_{(j)}\leq t} \frac{d_j}{n_j(n_j-d_j)}
\]
- With the variance, we can run statistical tests

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgn72ynHcM) clearly illustrates how to calculate the KM survival function.

```{r km_curve}
library(survival)

dim(dat3)

dim(ph)
ph$t_atrisk <- ph$end - ph$start

survobj <- with(ph, Surv(t_atrisk, event))
fit0 <- survfit(survobj~1, data=ph)
# summary(fit0)
plot(fit0, xlab="Time at risk of recidivism in Days", 
   ylab="% not rearrested", yscale=100,
   main ="Survival Distribution (Overall)") 

fitr <- survfit(survobj~race, data=ph)

legend('bottomleft', legend=levels(as.factor(ph$race)), col = c('red', 'blue', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'purple'), lty=1)

survdiff(survobj~race, data=ph)
```

Note: I haven't used this package in a long time so I needed to look how to use the functions in [documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/survival.pdf).  As a consultant, you will probably need to read the documentation a lot.

## Cox proportional hazards model

- Difficult to work with censored data using generalized linear models
- We can use use Poisson regression, how?
- Assuming that each individual hazard function is proportional to some common baseline hazard function makes the problem workable:
\[
\lambda(t|x_i) = \lambda_0(t) \exp(\beta x_i)
\]
where $X_i$ is the covariate vector for participant $i$ and $\beta$ is the parameter vector to be estimated
- $\lambda_0(t)$ is the hazard function for $x=0$
- $\exp(\beta x_i)$ explains proportional differences in hazards as $x_i$ changes as in parametric regression
- Then the probability that individual $j$ experiences an event at $t_{(j)}$ given survival until $t_{(j)}$ is
$$\lambda(t_{(j)}|x_{(j)})=\lambda_0(t_{(j)})\exp(x_{(j)}\beta)$$
- The total probability within the sample of an event occurring at time $t_{(j)}$ given those who have survived until $t_{(j)}$ is 
$$\sum_{k: t_k\geq t_{(j)}} \lambda(t_{(j)}|x_k) = \sum_{k: t_k\geq t_{(j)}} \lambda_0(t_{(j)})\exp(x_k\beta)$$
- Then probability of an event occurring at $t_{(j)}$ conditioning on covariates $x_{(j)}$ (the likelihood) is
$$\begin{align*}
L_j(\beta) &= P[(j)\text{ fails}|\text{1 failure from those at risk at $t_{(j)}$}]
= \frac{P[\text{$(j)$ fails}| \text{still at risk}]}{\sum_{k: t_k\geq t_{(j)}}P(\text{$k$ fails}| \text{still at risk})} \\
&= \frac{\lambda(t_{(j)}|x_{(j)})}{\sum_{k: t_k\geq t_{(j)}} \lambda(t_{(j)}|x_k)} = \frac{\lambda_0(t_{(j)})\exp(x_{(j)}\beta)}{\sum_{k: t_k\geq t_{(j)}} \lambda_0(t_{(j)})\exp(x_k\beta)}
= \frac{\exp(x_{(j)}\beta)}{\sum_{k: t_k\geq t_{(j)}} \exp(x_k\beta)}
\end{align*}$$
- Notice that the baseline hazard function, $\lambda_0(t)$, cancels.  So, now we can use use an optimization technique to maximize this function
- The joint likelihood for the sample is
$$\tilde L(\beta) = \prod_{j=1}^J L_j(\beta) = \prod_{j=1}^J \frac{\exp(x_{(j)}\beta)}{\sum_{k: t_k\geq t_{(j)}} \exp(x_k\beta)}
= \prod_{i=1}^n \left[\frac{\exp(x_i\beta)}{\sum_{\ell\in R(t_i)} \exp(x_\ell\beta)}\right]^{\delta_i}$$

- log-likelihood:
$$
\tilde \ell(\beta) = \sum_{j=1}^J\left[ x_{(j)}\beta - \log \left(\sum_{k: t_k\geq t_{(j)}} \exp(x_k\beta) \right)\right]
$$
where $R(t) = \left\{\ell: t_\ell \geq t\right\}$

- Maximize the likelihood with Newton-Raphson method

```

- Testing proportional hazards assumption
- Null Hypothesis: Proportional hazards
- Should consider transformation (next lecture)

```{r testAssumption}
test.ph <- cox.zph(coxph(survobj~race+age+decile_score, data=ph))
test.ph
```

- Using our knowledge of regression with causation (Bayesian Networks above), how can we determine if the COMPAS algorithm is racially biased?

**Time-Dependent Covariates**

- In cases, covariates can change over time
  - Here, zip code, or age can change over time
  - This change may have an effect on the hazard function
- Recall that $\lambda(t)$ is the instantaneous probability of an event at time $t$ given survival up to $t$
- If one or more covariates change over time, $x(t)$, we can model hazard as
$$\lambda(t|x(t)) = \lambda_0(t)\exp(\beta x(t))$$
- The partial likelihood become
$$\tilde L(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \left[\frac{\exp(x_i(t_i)\beta)}{\sum_{\ell\in R(t_i)} \exp(x_\ell(t_i)\beta)}\right]^{\delta_i}$$

**Stratified Models**

- If a sample of $n$ observations are thought to have $S$ mutually exclusive baseline hazards, we can choose to use a stratified model
$$\lambda_h(t|x) = \lambda_{0h}(t)\exp(x\beta) \text{ for } h=1,\dots,S$$
- Example: Want to assess effect of age and weight only on risk of death, we may want to stratify by gender
- If covariates are assumed to be different in different strata, we can estimate strata-specific parameters, $\beta_h$, for each strata
$$\lambda_h(t|x) = \lambda_{0h}(t)\exp(x\beta_h) \text{ for } h=1,\dots,S$$
- Partial likelihood:
$$\tilde L(\beta) = \prod_{h=1}^S \prod_{i=1}^{n_h} \left[\frac{\exp(x_{i(h)}\beta_h)}{\sum_{\ell\in R_h(t_{i(h)})} \exp(x_{\ell(h)\beta_h}))}\right]$$
where $n_h$ is the number in each strata, $i(h)$ is the $i$th observation in the $h$th stratam, $R_h$ is the stratam specific risk set

**Frailty model**

- Some data will have associations among the observations themselves
- Example: COMPAS data could have multiple arrests, their associated COMPAS score, and their own follow up
- It is reasonable to assume that past scores, and arrests may provide information (association) on future data
- If there are associations among the observations in the data, the parameter point estimates will be accurate
- But, standard error will not be correct, so any inference (p-values, confidence intervals) will not be valid
- Solution: modify the information sandwich for GLMs with associated observations to Cox PH
- This provides a consistent estimator for the covariance matrix
- Note: so far we have not discussed sandwich estimator

### Consulting Case Study: Treating Syphilis in People living with HIV

- The typically, the first line treatment for syphilis is penicillin
- But, people living with HIV are sometimes thought to be immunocompromised
- Because of this, it was common for physicians to administer two or more standard doses to treat syphilis for someone living with HIV
- US treatment guidelines in the US recommended one standard dose regardless of HIV status
- But, there was disagreement in the medical community on this guideline
- This type of disagreement (equipoise) frequently leads to research

**Background:** Treatment guidelines recommend the use of a single dose of benzathine penicillin G (BPG) for treating early syphilis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons. However, data supporting this rec- ommendation are limited. We examined the efficacy of single-dose BPG in the US Military HIV Natural History Study.

**Methods:** Subjects were included if they met serologic criteria for syphilis (ie, a positive nontreponemal test [NTr] confirmed by treponemal testing). Response to treatment was assessed at 13 months and was defined by a ≥4-fold decline in NTr titer. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were utilized to examine factors associated with treatment response.

**Results:** Three hundred fifty subjects (99% male) contributed 478 cases. Three hundred ninety-three cases were treated exclusively with BPG (141 with 1 dose of BPG). Treatment response was the same among those receiving 1 or >1 dose of BPG (92%). In a multivariate analysis, older age (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82 per 10-year increase; 95% con- fidence interval [CI], .73–.93) was associated with delayed response to treatment. Higher pretreatment titers (refer- ence NTr titer <1:64; HR, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.58–2.39]) and CD4 counts (HR, 1.07 for every 100-cell increase [95% CI, 1.01–1.12]) were associated with a faster response to treatment. Response was not affected by the number of BPG doses received (reference, 1 dose of BPG; HR, 1.11 [95% CI, .89–1.4]).

**Conclusion:** In this cohort, additional BPG doses did not affect treatment response. Our data support the current recommendations for the use of a single dose of BPG to treat HIV-infected persons with early syphilis.

## High Level Summary

- Always explore the data before running regressions and other statistical tests.  Look at the raw data itself, try to understand variable names, variable distributions, missing data, etc
- Collider bias occurs when conditioning (including as a covariate) on a variable that is influenced by the outcome variable and at least one other covariate.
- Survival analysis tools, such as Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox PH regression, are helpful when follow times leading up to an event vary by observation, especially when censoring occurs.
- When reporting on your analysis, it is important to be aware of possible causal pathways. But, most of the time, it is not possible to use statistical models alone to attribute a causal relationships.
